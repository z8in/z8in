  	‚Ä¢	Scenario design for concurrent users and system bottlenecks
  	‚Ä¢	KPI monitoring (response times, throughput, error rates)
  	‚Ä¢	Reporting & analysis with JTL/CSV/HTML outputs
	‚Ä¢	Data Analysis & Scripting
  	‚Ä¢	Python & Pandas for data wrangling and automation
  	‚Ä¢	SQL queries & validation (checksum functions, data comparisons)
  	‚Ä¢	Excel automation (comparisons, conditional formatting, visualizations)
  	‚Ä¢	JSON/XML parsing for test data & API responses
	‚Ä¢	Database & Backend Validation
  	‚Ä¢	Oracle SQL Developer for deep database analysis and QA
  	‚Ä¢	Writing advanced SQL queries, joins, and window functions
  	‚Ä¢	Validating schema changes, table audits, and data consistency
  	‚Ä¢	Working with multiple environments (Dev, Test, PreProd, Prod)
	‚Ä¢	Dev & QA Practices
  	‚Ä¢	Regression testing in multiple environments
  	‚Ä¢	Production Verification Testing (PVT) in read-only and read-write modes
  	‚Ä¢	Confluence documentation & JIRA tracking
  	‚Ä¢	Collaboration with cross-functional teams (Dev, BE, FE, QA, PM, Clients)
